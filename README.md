# uacs-server

This is the django server for a [FAU FabLab's UniversalAccessControl system](https://github.com/fau-fablab/uacs-client).

Users are models in a [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) db. The db can just be edited by using the dbs admin interface atm.
It provides `JSON` objects at the URL `/server/users/<id>`
